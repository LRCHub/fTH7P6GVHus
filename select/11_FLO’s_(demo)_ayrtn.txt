(Young whoppa, on your blocka, and I got the choppa)
Uh

Man I got plenty of hoes (whoa)
And I got plenty of flows (facts)

Wait, look (ayy, ayy)
I just pulled up in a surfboard (skrt)
You niggas boring, man I'm so bored
You had a chance but you didn't score (wait)
(You had a chance but you didn't score)
(?) and then a fucking sword

Hit up the chip shop
Man I just do it my life is on gridlock
I got it on lockdown
I just hit it up, tell another to come around
Aye watch your head my lyrics is
Forcing brothers to SKIDROW (bow, bow)
See me in the flesh, they wanna take pics
Now that shit annoying as shit now
I know my worth, I'm worth a lot (facts)
You can catch me at the spot
Niggas lacking, I ain't shocked (true)
Pussy niggas they ain't tryna see profit
Me and my niggas the topic
On this journey full of knowledge (ayy)
Now I'm running from the tropics ('low it)
Make a beat it ain't on logic
Stop it
Man I got the fruity loops (facts)
And I'm tryna see the vision through prisms
I'm tryna make it to the loop (the loop)
I cannot love no bitch
If she been around the shit I rebuke (no way)
Wait
The bag is right in front of my face
I cannot refuse (ayy)
I'm moving steady
I was thinking

Man I got the sauce
Had to make money checks to the law
(?) got packs that's (?)
Pussy niggas talking, man they act like whores
And I'm balling like I'm Paul George
Had to take a lil break I had to pause
Niggas know I'm the main source
I'm the plug, getting money, niggas snored

Opened up a couple doors (ayy)
Man I had to get the readys (yup)
Had to maintain my shit, I can't ever quit (no way)
Keep my shit steady
I just had to hit the belly (wait)
Loud pack coming smelly (uh)
Gyally with a fat back, throw it back
Jiggle jiggle like jelly (nice)
Niggas know me
Man I got plenty of hoes (whoa)
And I got plenty of flows (facts)

Wait, look (ayy, ayy)
I just pulled up in a surfboard (skrt)
You niggas boring, man I'm so bored
You had a chance but you didn't score (wait)
(You had a chance but you didn't score)
(?) and then a fucking sword

Hit up the chip shop
Man I just do it my life is on gridlock
I got it on lockdown
I just hit it up, tell another to come around
Aye watch your head my lyrics is
Forcing brothers to SKIDROW (bow, bow)
See me in the flesh, they wanna take pics
Now that shit annoying as shit now
